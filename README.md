# Hello there 👋

I'm Jakub, a high-school student (junior year) and Team Maintainer & Co-Founder at [EternalCodeTeam](https://github.com/EternalCodeTeam).
I am mainly focused in Java Development and accelerating my workflow using the Gradle build tool. I also like to reverse-engineer some JARs from time to time 😅

📦 My most notable project is the [ParcelLockers](https://github.com/EternalCodeTeam/ParcelLockers) plugin, which aims to add functionality of InPost parcel lockers to Minecraft.
